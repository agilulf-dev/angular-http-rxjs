# AngularHttpRxjs

The project, in Angular + Express, explore methodologies of Http request with RxJs, 
with focus in situations in which request cancellation can happen or might be beneficial.

Consider a scenario in which a user clicking a button, usually
that triggers an HTTP request or, for example, navigating away from a page 
and we want to avoid unnecessary Http request in order to improve performance and also user experience.

## Run project
